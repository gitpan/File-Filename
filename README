File::Filename - expect a filename to be named by a person to be metadata
=========================================================================

A lot of people use the filename as a place to insert metadata for the file.
This module has some routines to help with treating those filenames.
This code takes into consideration what human beings would name files as.

People often expect a space to be *part of* something.
To us, used to the prompt, a space is a delimiter, not a delimeter.

People see an underscore and it is a delimiter to them, but to us it is a "word character".
This is one of a colleciton of modules to help consolidate the real world of file archiving
in offices (multiple human users naming files by hand) with the
needs of people maintaining such filesystem hierarchy structures.
